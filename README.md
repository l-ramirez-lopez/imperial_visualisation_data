This repository holds data and basic information for this project which focuses on the study of sales and rent prices in four different cities in Spain (Alicante, Elche, Granada and Seville). The goal of our study was to develop spatially resolved data models, including heat maps, of the rents/sales ratio to study patterns in housing affordability, investment opportunities, and market dynamics.

We combine data obtained from the [idealista API](https://www.idealista.com/en/data/asesoramiento-inmobiliario-tecnologico/analisis-mercado-inmobiliario/)
with spatial information obatined from the new [google places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/op-overview/). The raw data is under the folder `data/raw` in 

The `data` folder contains the aggregated data for the different cities. 

The `notebooks` folder contains some of the jupyter notebooks used to prepare the data. 

Note that this repository does not contain the final report nor code used to analyse and model the data.
